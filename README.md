The Role of Twitter in the Canadian Federal Election: This project should examine the
construction of migration- a distinctly contentious and multi-faceted issue with considerable implications for the constitution of citizenship and political community- on Twitter during the 2019 Canadian Federal election. Employing both quantitative and qualitative content analysis you should provide an assessment of the role of various actors- government agencies, political parties, journalists, civil society groups, lay citizens, bots, etc.- in shaping and steering online discussions of migration and its ostensible effects.
